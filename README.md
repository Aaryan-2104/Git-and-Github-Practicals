Overview

This repository is dedicated to conducting and documenting various experiments related to Git and Github. Each experiment is designed to test specific hypotheses, gather data, and make informed decisions to improve the project.

Experiment 1: Git Installation and Repository Creation
Objective: In this experiment, we installed Git, created a local Git repository, and established a connection with a remote repository on GitHub. Additionally, a GitHub account was created to store the remote repository.

Steps:
Install Git on your local machine.
Create a new local Git repository using the git init command.
Connect the local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
Set up a GitHub account for remote repository storage.


Experiment 2: Branch Creation and Merging
Objective: In this experiment, we focused on branching in Git. A new branch was created on GitHub, and changes were made within that branch. Finally, the changes from the branch were merged into the main branch.

Steps:
Create a new branch on GitHub using the branch creation feature.
Make changes within the newly created branch.
Merge the changes from the branch into the main branch using the GitHub interface.


Experiment 3: Pull Requests and Merging Changes
Objective: The objective of this experiment was to introduce and explore the pull request command. Pull requests were created to propose changes, and these changes were merged both in the local repository and on the remote repository.

Steps:
Create and explore the pull request command on GitHub.
Propose changes using a pull request.
Merge the changes locally using Git commands.
Merge the changes on the remote repository through the GitHub interface.
